Given two integer inputs, check whether they form a friendly pair or not. A pair of two numbers is said to be friendly if the ratio of the sum of the factors of a number except the number itself upon the number, for both numbers, matches. Print "Yes" if the numbers given form a friendly pair, otherwise print "No".

Input Format

Two integers

Constraints

None

Output Format

A single string

Sample Input 0

6 28
Sample Output 0

Yes
Explanation 0

The factors of 6 and 28 except the numbers themselves are 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 respectively.
Now the sum of factors of both the numbers are 6 and 28 respectively.
When we divide the sums with the numbers we get 1 and 1 respectively.
As the ratio of both the number match, they are considered as a friendly pair.
