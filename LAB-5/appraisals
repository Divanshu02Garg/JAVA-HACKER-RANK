XYZ Technologies is in the process of incrementing the salary of its employees. This increment is done based on their salary and their performance appraisal rating.

If the appraisal rating is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
