N monkeys are sitting on the branches of a huge tree. As travelers offer bananas and peanuts, the monkeys jump down the tree. Every monkey can eat b bananas or p peanuts. If total i number of bananas and j number of peanuts are offered by travelers, calculate the number of monkeys left hungry.

At a time, one monkey gets down and finishes eating and goes to the other side of the road.

A monkey can either eat b bananas or p peanuts. If less than b bananas and less than p peanuts are left on the ground, the monkey who eats last will eat them all.

Write code to take inputs N, b, p, i, j and return the number of monkeys left hungry.

where,

N = Total no of monkeys
b = Number of bananas eaten by a single monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get less than b bananas)
p = Number of peanuts eaten by a single monkey(Monkey that jumped down last may get less than p peanuts)
i = Total number of bananas
j = Total number of peanuts
All inputs must be positive. If any of the input (N, b, p, i, j) is not positive, display "INVALID INPUT"

Input Format

Five integers N, b, p, i, j are given in a single line.

Constraints

None

Output Format

A single integer representing number of monkeys left hungry.

Sample Input 0

20 2 3 12 12
Sample Output 0

10
Explanation 0

Total monkeys = 20
Every monkey eats 2 bananas or 3 peanuts.
Bananas = 12, Peanuts = 12.
Monkeys eating bananas = 6 (0 bananas left)
Monkeys eating peanuts = 4 (0 peanuts left)
Monkeys who ate = 10
Hungry monkeys = 20 - 10 = 10
