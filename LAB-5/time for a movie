Refreshments can also be opted for by paying an additional of ₹50 per member.

Explanation 0

Price calculation:

Number of tickets = 35
Refreshments = 'y'
Coupon code = 'n'
Class = 'q'
Total Cost of 35 tickets of q class = (35 * 150) = 5250
Bulk Discount = 10% of 5250 = 525
Refreshment Cost = 50*35 = 1750
Total Cost = 5250 - 525 + 1750 = 6475.00
