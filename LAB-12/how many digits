// Nobita was given the responsibility to collect marks of all the students for a class test. The marks were out of 9 (a student can score between 1 and 9 marks). Nobita wrote down all the marks consecutively, without spaces. He now needs to tell, how many students gave the exam. Help him out by making a code that takes the number (formed by writing all the marks without spaces) a input and gives number of students as output.

// Input Format

// A single integer.

// Constraints

// None

// Output Format

// A single integer (number of students).

// Sample Input 0

// 56782318
// Sample Output 0

// 8
